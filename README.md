    "Gardening involves growing plants, including flowers, vegetables, and fruit trees. "
    "Roses require well-drained soil and at least six hours of direct sunlight daily. "
    "Vegetable gardens need organic compost and balanced fertilizers like NPK 10-10-10. "
    "Fruit trees should be watered deeply once a week and pruned regularly. "
    "Composting enriches soil fertility, and crop rotation helps prevent soil depletion. "
    "Seasonal planting enhances growth, and understanding plant compatibility reduces pests. "
    "Tomatoes grow best in full sunlight with well-draining soil and require regular watering. "
    "Carrots prefer loose, sandy soil with deep watering to encourage root growth. "
    "Lettuce grows best in cooler temperatures and needs regular moisture. "
    "Cucumbers require trellising for best growth and need frequent watering. "
    "Potted plants need well-draining soil and should be watered when the topsoil is dry. "
    "Mulching helps retain soil moisture and suppresses weeds. "
    "Organic fertilizers such as composted manure and bone meal improve soil fertility. "
    "Overwatering can cause root rot, while underwatering leads to wilting. "
    "Pruning fruit trees in winter encourages healthy growth. "
    "Pollinators like bees and butterflies help plants produce fruit. "
    "Marigolds can help repel pests in vegetable gardens. "
    "Indoor plants such as succulents need indirect sunlight and minimal watering. "
    "Hydroponic gardening allows plants to grow without soil, using nutrient-rich water. "
    "Gardening in raised beds helps improve soil drainage and makes weeding easier. "
    "Companion planting, such as growing basil with tomatoes, helps improve plant health. "
    "Drip irrigation is an efficient way to water plants while conserving water."
