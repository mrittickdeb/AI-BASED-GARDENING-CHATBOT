gardening_context = """
Gardening involves growing plants, including flowers, vegetables, herbs, and fruit trees.

=== FLOWERS ===
Roses require well-drained soil (pH 6.0-6.5) and at least six hours of direct sunlight daily. Prune in early spring and deadhead regularly.
Lilies prefer well-drained, slightly acidic soil and grow best in full to partial sunlight. Plant bulbs 4-6 inches deep in fall or spring.
Sunflowers need full sun and should be planted after last frost. They grow quickly and can reach 6-12 feet tall.
Tulips are spring-blooming bulbs that should be planted in fall, 6-8 inches deep in well-drained soil.
Hydrangeas change color based on soil pH - blue in acidic soil (pH <5.5), pink in alkaline (pH >6.5).

=== VEGETABLES ===
Vegetables are the unsung heroes of nutrition and flavor! They come in a dazzling variety, from leafy greens like spinach and kale, to root vegetables like carrots and radishes, to fruiting vegetables like tomatoes and bell peppers
Tomatoes grow best in full sunlight with well-draining soil (pH 6.0-6.8). Water 1-2 inches weekly and support with stakes or cages.
Carrots prefer loose, sandy soil with deep watering to encourage root growth. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep, 2 inches apart.
Peppers need warm soil (70Â°F+) and consistent moisture. Harvest when fruits reach full size and color.
Zucchini is a prolific summer squash that needs plenty of space (plant 3 feet apart) and regular harvesting.
Leafy greens like lettuce and spinach prefer cooler temperatures (60-70Â°F) and moist, fertile soil.

=== FRUITS ===
Strawberries grow best in full sun with rich, well-drained soil. Plant in spring and mulch around plants.
Blueberries need acidic soil (pH 4.0-5.5) and consistent moisture. Prune old canes in winter.
Apple trees require cross-pollination between different varieties. Prune in late winter to maintain shape.
Citrus trees (lemons, oranges) need warm climates (or containers in cold areas) and well-drained soil.

=== HERBS ===
Basil grows best in warm weather and full sun. Pinch off flowers to encourage leaf growth.
Mint prefers partial shade and moist soil. It spreads aggressively, so contain in pots.
Rosemary needs well-drained soil and full sun. It's drought-tolerant once established.
Parsley grows well in both sun and partial shade. Soak seeds overnight before planting.

=== GARDENING TECHNIQUES ===
Composting requires a balance of green (nitrogen-rich) and brown (carbon-rich) materials. Turn pile every 2-4 weeks.
Mulching with 2-4 inches of organic material helps retain moisture and suppress weeds.
Crop rotation prevents soil depletion and reduces pest/disease problems. Rotate plant families annually.
Raised beds improve drainage, reduce weeds, and allow better soil control. Ideal height is 12-18 inches.
Drip irrigation conserves water by delivering it directly to plant roots. Reduces leaf diseases.
Container gardening is ideal for small spaces. Use pots with drainage holes and quality potting mix.
