Gardening involves growing plants, including flowers, vegetables, and fruit trees.

Roses require well-drained soil and at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.

Vegetable gardens need organic compost and balanced fertilizers like NPK 10-10-10.

Fruit trees should be watered deeply once a week and pruned regularly.

Composting enriches soil fertility, and crop rotation helps prevent soil depletion.

tomatoes grow best in full sunlight with well-draining soil and require regular watering.

Carrots prefer loose, sandy soil with deep watering to encourage root growth.

Lettuce grows best in cooler temperatures and needs regular moisture.

Cucumbers require trellising for best growth and need frequent watering.

Potted plants need well-draining soil and should be watered when the topsoil is dry.

Mulching helps retain soil moisture and suppresses weeds.

Organic fertilizers such as composted manure and bone meal improve soil fertility.

Pollinators like bees and butterflies help plants produce fruit.

Indoor plants such as succulents need indirect sunlight and minimal watering.

Hydroponic gardening allows plants to grow without soil, using nutrient-rich water.

Raised beds improve drainage, reduce weeds, and allow better soil control.

Drip irrigation is an efficient watering method that conserves water and prevents disease.
